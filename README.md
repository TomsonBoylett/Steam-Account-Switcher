# Steam-Account-Switcher
## Warning: The steam username and password will be visible in plaintext on the command line.

Allows quickly switching between steam accounts.

Add accounts to settings.txt as well as specifying the steam location.

It works by ending any active steam proceses then logs into the new account using steam's command line options.
